## Starting the game
## Old info
First, the server needs to be started. The code is in slaane/iti0301-2024-server. 
The server starts from main() inside server/src/java/ee.taltech.game.server/GameServer

Client can be started with gradle iti0301-2024-game/Tasks/other/run. 
NB: The dev branch should be used.

## For starting game after 14.05.2024
1. Make a clone of the code and open it with IDE(intellij).
2. By just running it should work but if not then under DesktopLauncher there is main and run that.
